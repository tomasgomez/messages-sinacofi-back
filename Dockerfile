# Use an official Node runtime as a parent image

# Set the working directory in the container

# Use ARG to define the build-time environment variable that specifies which .env file to use

# Copy package.json and yarn.lock files
COPY package.json ./
COPY yarn.lock ./

# Install dependencies
RUN yarn install --frozen-lockfile

# Copy the rest of your app's source code from your host to your image filesystem.
COPY . .

# Copy the appropriate .env file based on the build-time environment variable
COPY .env ./.env

# Here we will use the Next.js start script which starts the production server
